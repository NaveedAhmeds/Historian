            The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially &quot;the
            Met&quot;, is the largest art museum in the Americas. Its permanent
            collection contains over two million works, divided among 17
            curatorial departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue,
            along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park on
            Manhattan&apos;s Upper East Side, is by area one of the world&apos;s largest
            art museums. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort
            Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of
            art, architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe. <br />
            <br />
            The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its
            mission to bring art and art education to the American people. The
            museum&apos;s permanent collection consists of works of art from
            classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures
            from nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of
            American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of
            African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is
            home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes,
            and accessories, as well as antique weapons and armor from around
            the world. Several notable interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome
            through modern American design, are installed in its galleries.
